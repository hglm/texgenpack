texgenpack v0.8.2 -- texture compression using a genetic algorithm.

**** Introduction ****

This program is texture compression and conversion utility that uses a genetic
algorithm to compress textures. It uses the GA implementation in libfgen to
compress textures. Using a general genetic algorithm is a slow method, but is
robust and inherently multi-threaded so it can use all available cores in the
CPU. It also has the advantage that numerous formats can be supported, since
only a decompression function has to be provided to support a new format. The
program can also convert to and from several compressed and uncompressed
texture formats and file types such as KTX and DDS, including support for
multiple mipmaps and automatic mipmap generation.

Although deleveloped on and mainly targeting Linux, there is also some (dated)
support for Windows (for instructions, see the end of the file).

**** Linux installation instructions ****

On Linux, run "make" to compile which generated the executables texgenpack
(command line) and texgenpack-gui (GUI texture viewer and compressor using GTK+)
and optionally "sudo make install" to install to the default installation
directory. Edit the Makefile to change the installation directory or compilation
flags.

Prerequisites for compilation:

	libpng (development version)
	GTK+ 3 development libraries (for GUI program)
	libfgen (https://github.com/hglm/libfgen.git)

For example, the complete compilation and installation process on a Debian-
ased system might look like this:

	sudo apt-get install libpng12-dev
	sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev
	git clone https://github.com/hglm/libfgen.git
	cd libfgen
	make
	sudo make install
	cd ..
	# Clone texgenpack if not already done.
	git clone https://github.com/hglm/texgenpack.git
        cd texgenpack
	make
	sudo make install

**** Features and description ****

The following texture formats are supported:

- ETC1, the mobile standard and compatible with the new standardized ETC2
  format in OpenGL 4.3 and OpenGL ES 3.0.
- ETC2, an improved version of ETC1. RGB8 as well as RGBA8 and RGB8 with
  punchthrough alpha are supported.
- Preliminary support for one or two component textures (stored as one or
  two 16-bit values in an image file): R11_EAC and RG11_EAC and their signed
  variants. These are part of the ETC2 family.
- DXT1, DXT3, DXT5 and DXT1A (also known as BC1/2/3 or S3TC).
- RGTC1/RGTC2 (BC4/BC5) for one and two component textures.
- BPTC (BC7), a high-quality RGBA compression format.
- BPTC_FLOAT and BPTC_SIGNED_FLOAT (BC6H_UF16 and BC6H_SF16) for both linear
  and HDR textures.
- ASTC via ARM's encoder.

The following file formats are supported:

- KTX, an OpenGL standard, multiple mipmap levels supported with multitude
  of texture formats.
- PKM, for ETC textures containing a single mipmap level.
- DDS, for DXTC, RGTC, BPTC (BC1-7) or uncompressed textures, multiple mipmap
  levels supported.

PNG is the only supported image format. You'll have to convert images to PNG
before using the compress function (you can also use KTX or DDS files, either
compressed or uncompressed as source).

The program supports compression, decompression and comparison of image files
and textures, reporting RMSE and PSNR statistics of the difference between
images, and handles mipmaps.

Because of the general nature of the method used, it is relatively easy to add
new compression formats to the code; only a decompression function is required
to enable compression of that format.

Run the commmand line utility texgenpack without arguments for instructions.

Basically, one command should be specified as the first argument, either
--compress, --decompress or --compare. The last two arguments on the command
line should be the source and destination files in that order. Various options
are available.

The, speed/quality level is set using --level <number>, with <number> in the
range 0 to 50. The options --ultra, --fast (default), --medium and --slow
correspond to quality level presets of 0, 8, 16 and 32, respectively.

**** Formats ****

Use --format to select the format for compression (the default when the
destination is a KTX or PKM file is ETC1, for DDS it is DXT1). The --progress
option will display a progress percentage as the algorithm runs.

Examples:

	texgenpack --compress --format etc2_rgb8 --progress image.png texture.ktx
	texgenpack --compare image.png texture.ktx
	texgenpack --decompress texture.ktx decompressed.png

Formats supported by the --format option include:

	- "etc1": ETC1, an RGB8 format. 64-bit per block (4x4 pixels).
	- "etc2_rgb8": The ETC2 RGB8 format that is backwards compatible with
          ETC1. 64-bit.
	- "etc2_eac": The ETC2 RGBA8 format with alpha values ranging from 0
          to 255. 128-bit blocks.
	- "etc2_punchthrough": RGB8 + alpha that is either on or off (0 or
	  255). 64-bit blocks.
	- "dxt1": RGB8, the most used standard on PCs.
	- "dxt3": RGBA8.
	- "dxt5": RGBA8.
	- "dxt1a": Variant of DXT1 with on/off alpha. When decompressing or
	  comparing a DDS file containing a DXT1A texture the option --format
	  dxt1a should be specified.
	- "r11_eac": A single 16-bit component. Stored in the lower 16-bits
          (R and G) with little endian byte order of a 32-bit pixel of a PNG
	  image with alpha.
	- "rg11_eac": Two 16-bit components. Stored as two 16-bit values,
          in the lower (R and G) and upper (B and alpha) 16-bits of a PNG
          image with alpha.
	- "signed_r11_eac": A single signed 16-bit component.
	- "signed_rg11_eac": Two signed 16-bit components.
	- "rgb8": Uncompressed RGB8.
	- "rgba8": Uncompressed RGBA8.
	- "rgb_half_float": Uncompressed format where each color component is
	  stored in a 16-bits floating point number.
	- "rgba_half_float": Includes alpha.
	- "bptc": High quality recent 128-bit compressed format, also known
           as BC7. Supports alpha.
	- "bptc_float": Half-float RGB format, also known as BC6H_UF16. --hdr
	  option supported for HDR textures.
	- "bptc_signed_float": Signed half-float format, also known as
	   BC6H_SF16.
	- "rgtc1": Single-channel (red) compression format. Equivalent to BC4.
	- "rgtc2": Two channel (red/green) compression format. Equivalent to
	   BC5.
	- "signed_rgtc1": Signed version of RGTC1.
	- "signed_rgtc2 : Signed version of RGTC2.

The program supports the use of higher precision source formats than the base
format of the compression format. For example, it is possible to use half-
float images or textures as a source for 8-bit RGB compression formats.
Provided the source image does indeed have higher precision (and is not just
an 8-bit image converted to half-float format), this should result in improved
quality. The same applies to the use of 16-bit source formats for one or two
component compression with RGTC.

**** Quality level settings ****

The first class of quality levels (0 to 7) only performs a single try at
compressing a particular 4x4 pixel block. Eight blocks are compressed in
parallel. Due the nature of the genetic algorithm, the compression quality
can vary so this class has relatively high chance of blocks with a low
compression quality being present. For levels 0 to 7, the number of
generations of the genetic agorithm increases from 100 to 275. The --ultra
quality preset corresponds to level 0.

The second class of quality levels (8 to 32) performs multiple tries at
compressing a particular 4x4 pixel block. The best result is used. The
number of tries is equal to the quality level settings, so for levels 8
to 32, the number of tries per block ranges from 8 to 32. A higher number
of tries increases the quality of the resulting compressed texture. The
--fast preset corresponds to level 8, --medium to level 16, and --slow
to level 32.

The third class of quality levels (33 to 50) uses 32 tries, like level 32
(equal to --slow setting), but increases the number of generations of the
genetic algorithm proportional to the quality level. For levels 33 to 50,
the initial number of generations increases from 60 to 230 with a step size
of 10.

For compression levels in the range 8 to 50, an adaptive scheme has been
implemented whereby the number of generations of the genetic algorithm is
doubled or tripled when the compressed block is not of sufficient quality.

For all compression levels, a short second-pass is performed that uses
a genetic algorithm with a small population size to fine-tune the end result.

**** Graphical interface (texgenpack-gui) ****

The graphical viewer and compression program texgenpack-gui uses GTK+ 3. It
accepts zero, one or two image or texture filenames as arguments.

The GUI program can be use to compress or convert images and textures. Amongst
other features, it has options to adjust the number of components, convert
components to to 8 and 16-bit unsigned or signed formats or to half-float
format, generate mipmaps. Apart from texture compression, the program (just
like the command line utility) can be used to convert uncompressed textures
from one format to another.

Advantages of the GUI program include immediate quality indication and
information about the duration of the compression process.

**** Miscelleanous remarks about texgenpack ****

- The compression is fairly slow at the default setting (--fast). The --ultra
  preset is faster but sacrifices quality. The higher quality settings
  --medium and --slow produce better quality but are slow.
- The code has not been tested on big-endian systems although they are
  supported. Loading of KTX files created on a big-endian system should work
  correctly.
- The ETC1 and ETC2 RGB8 compression has been debugged, and seems work
  correctly. I'd like to hear about any incompabilities.
- There is an option (--mipmaps) to automatically generate mipmap levels
  both for power-of-two and non-power-of-two textures, and save them in a
  KTX or DDS file. The quality of the results has not been extensively
  verified.
- The program can be used to generate or extract mipmaps with or without
  compression or decompression.
- Because of the nature of the algorithm, which only requires a decoding
  function of a particular compression format to perform compression, this
  program could help to evaluate or research texture compression schemes in
  general.

Also included is the viewer and conversion program texgenpack-gui which can
view, compare, convert and also compress all formats that texgenpack handles.
It has zooming support, support for showing differences between textures/
images, and support for HDR textures. It requires GTK+ 3 or GTK+ 2 to build.

**** Windows instructions ****

The Windows port is out of date. The included binary does not support the
--level option.

The supplied 32-bit texgenpack.exe v0.6.1 (in the Release directory) was built
with Visual C++ 2010 with static libary versions of libfgen and libpng 1.60. As
such, the only requirements are the presence of the C run-time library
msvcrt100.dll and pthreadVC2.dll from the pthread-win32 project. The latter
file can be found on the pthread_win32 site project's pages at
http://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32/. It is also included in the libfgen
distribution.

A Visual C++ 2010 project file is also provided. To build the texview program,
a Windows GTK 2 or 3 installation is required and there are some details to
consider. The GTK installation may provide header and .lib files for libpng.
Because the older C run-time msvcrt.dll, linked with the "official" GTK 2
Windows distribution, conflicts with the msvcrt100.dll found in Visual C++
2010, use of that GTK distribution is not recommended unless you are able to
compile libfgen and texview itself with an old version of Visual C++ so that
only msvcrt.dll is used.

Because the program uses 64-bit instructions extensively in some compression
modes, compiling a 64-bit version should result in marked performance
improvement on 64-bit systems.
